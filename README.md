MMED 2025: Modelling the relationship between age and infection probability in insect vectors of disease

**Group members including**: 

- Davryn
- Shadé
- Georgia
- Mercy
- Tlamelo 

**Goal:**
Investigate how the prevalence of infection in insect vectors changes as a function of vector age.

**Specific focus:**
Study Trypanosomiasis (“tryps”) in Africa, transmitted by tsetse flies

**Tsetse fly modeling**
The age of female tsetse can be estimated accurately.
Enables precise analysis of infection acquisition rate by age.

**Data source:**
Dissection results from female tsetse (G. pallidipes) collected at Rekomitjie Research Station, Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe.
Data includes fly age and presence/absence of T. vivax and T. congolense infection.

**Activities:**
Development and comparison of different models for the acquisition of Trypanosomiasis in Tsetse flies

- Explore how acquisition of Trypanosomiasis may depend on specific speciation
- Explore how biting rate and/or probability of infection per bite may depend on tsetse age

**Skills acquired:**
The construction, execution and interpretation of multi-state models includingh a little about the mysteries of tsetse and trypanosomiasis.

**Good match for those wanting to:**
- Work with real biological data
- Develop modeling skills for simple stochastic models

**POA**
- Davryn to write introduction to be initailly reviewed by Shade
- Shadé to write up methods initailly reviewed by Davryn 
- Issues and limitations to be written and initailly reviewed by Mercy and Tlamelo 
- Results section to be written up by Georgi initailly reviewed by Shade
- All togther
  - reviewing slides and project 
  - idealisation of models 
  - results discussion   

**End goals**
- Pattern and rate of disease aquisition differs by species 
  - 1st Simple catalytic model (enzyme kinetics)
  - 2nd Model where stages of disease are SI 
  - Third more realistic SEI

**Notes: 23 June**
- Check google doc
- Each section needs a writer and a reviewer 
- Final report; presentation and analysis 
- Catalytic model to be coded individually and compared
- Final model pushed to git 
- Following models will be split into two groups (with one main coder per group) followed from group's ideation of models
